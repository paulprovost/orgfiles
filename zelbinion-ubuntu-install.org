** [2010-02-10 Wed]
   - Slow performance. Webmail (RoundCube) moved to aurorachair.
   - Disable graphical login as per [[http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/prevent-xorg-from-starting-in-linux/][this]] page.
     - Used [[http://www.debianadmin.com/manage-linux-init-or-startup-scripts.html][rcconf]] - Apparently, this is not the way in 9.10 and up.
     - Try [[http://ubuntu-ky.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php%3Fp%3D8239539&postcount%3D15][this]]. Edit the /etc/init/gdm.conf file.
     - Better!
