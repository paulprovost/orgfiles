* Reading mail from IMAP server in gnus                         :@imap:@gnus:
  - 
* Updating the index.org file for MobileOrg
  From a list of files in the directory pointed to by the
  org-directory variable:
  : (shell-command "cd ~/documents/orgfiles; find -type f -name \"*.org\" | sort" (quote (4)) nil)
** TODO Make a Python script for this!
   - Called with the directory name and returns the formatted list to
     stdout, ready for index.org
     - .org extension only
     - paths relative to the org directory
     - Prepended with file: (to make links)
     - file names prepended with ** + the directory level
     - List of excluded files
