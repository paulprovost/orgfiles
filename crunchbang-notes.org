* I am using [[http://crunchbanglinux.org/][CrunchBang linux]] as a portable linux install

* Keyboard
  I like to use the us-intl keyboard (or equivalent)
  everywhere. Here's how to do it in CrunchBang
  : setxkbmap us -variant intl
  I have not found how to do it on startup (yet)

* VNC viewer                                                           :@vnc:
  For now, using xvnc4viewer. I wrapped the calls in some sh scripts
  so that I can start them from dmenu (Alt-F3) or gmrun (Alt-F2)
** TODO Figure how to store VNC passwords

   :END:
   There should be a passwd file in ~/.vnc. But what's the format?

* Claws-Mail                                                         :@claws:
** Setting most folders to not be checked for new mail
   In the .claws-mail directory, there is a folderitemrc file. Each
   customized folder has an entry in this file. it starts with the
   folder name, e.g.
   : [#imap/Bouzou/Sent]
   followed by a bunch of options. The insteresting one here is:
   : newmailcheck=0
*** NEXT Write a script to update the claws-mail folderitemrc file
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2011-03-07 Mon 12:14]

    :END:
    - Read the list of folders on the IMAP server.
    - Update the folderitemrc file using From a list of files that we
      _do_ want to scan.
