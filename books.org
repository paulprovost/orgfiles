  Four decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa
  family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British
  Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade
  marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed
  an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to
  burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing
  factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like
  many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold
  pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young
  professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and
  armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.

  For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his
  aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a
  venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group,
  Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing
  game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes
  dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a
  virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.

  In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most
  ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain
  of his cyberpunk masterpieces Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon, leading
  readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of
  imagination.

  Despite wars with Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as 9/11, the United
  States’ dependence on foreign oil has kept the nation tied to the
  Middle East. A scientist has developed a cure for America’s
  addiction—a slow-acting virus that feeds on petroleum, turning it
  solid. But he didn’t consider that his contagion of an Iraqi oil
  field would spread to infect the fuel supply of the entire world…
 
  In Los Angeles, screenwriter Dave Marshall heard this scenario from
  a retired U.S. Marine and government insider who acted as a
  consultant on Dave’s last film. It sounded as implausible as many of
  his scripts, but the reality is much more frightening than anything
  he can envision.
 
  An ordinary guy armed with extraordinary information, Dave hopes his
  survivor’s instinct will kick in so he can protect his wife and
  daughter from the coming apocalypse that will alter the future of
  Earth—and humanity…

  Alex Lomax is the one and only private eye working the mean streets
  of New Klondike, the Martian frontier town that sprang up forty
  years ago after Simon Weingarten and Denny O’Reilly discovered
  fossils on the Red Planet. Back on Earth, where anything can be
  synthesized, the remains of alien life are the most valuable of all
  collectibles, so shiploads of desperate treasure hunters stampeded
  to Mars in the Great Martian Fossil Rush.

  Trying to make an honest buck in a dishonest world, Lomax tracks
  down killers and kidnappers among the failed prospectors, corrupt
  cops, and a growing population of transfers—lucky stiffs who, after
  striking paleontological gold, upload their minds into immortal
  android bodies. But when he uncovers clues to solving the
  decades-old murders of Weingarten and O’Reilly, along with a journal
  that may lead to their legendary mother lode of Martian fossils, God
  only knows what he’ll dig up...

  In the wilds of Mongolia, a research satellite has crashed,
  triggering an explosive search for its valuable cargo: a code-black
  physics project connected to the study of dark energy—and a shocking
  image of the eastern seaboard of the United States in utter ruin.
 
  At the Vatican, a package arrives containing two strange artifacts:
  a skull scrawled with ancient Aramaic and a tome bound in human
  skin. DNA evidence reveals that both came from the same body: the
  long dead Mongol king Genghis Khan.
 
  Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force set out to discover a truth
  tied to the fall of the Roman Empire, to a mystery going back to the
  birth of Christianity, and to a weapon hidden for centuries that
  holds the fate of humanity.

  Galilee, 1025. Infiltrating an ancient citadel, a Templar knight
  uncovers a holy treasure long hidden within the fortress's
  labyrinth: the Bachal Isu -- the staff of Jesus Christ -- a
  priceless icon that holds a mysterious and terrifying power that
  promises to change humankind forever.

  A millennium later, Somali pirates hijack a yacht off the coast of
  the Horn of Africa, kidnapping a young pregnant American
  woman. Commander Gray Pierce is enlisted for a covert rescue mission
  into the African jungle. The woman is no rich tourist: she's Amanda
  Gant-Bennett, daughter of the U.S. president.

  Suspicious that the kidnapping masks a far more nefarious plot, Gray
  must confront a shadowy cabal which has been manipulating events
  throughout history...and now challenges the current presidency.

  For this unique mission, SIGMA is aided by a pair of special
  operatives with unique talents: former Army Ranger Captain Tucker
  Wayne and his military war dog, Kane. But what should be a
  straightforward rescue turns into a fiery ambush and a deadly act of
  betrayal, as Gray and his team discover that the hostage is a pawn
  in a shattering act of terrorism with dark repercussions. And the
  danger is only beginning...

  Halfway around the world, a firebombing at a fertility clinic in
  South Carolina exposes a conspiracy that goes back centuries...a
  scheme that lies within our genetic code. With time against them,
  SIGMA must race to save an innocent unborn baby whose very existence
  raises questions about the nature of humanity, asking:

  Could you live forever? 

  Would you live forever?

  From New York Times bestselling author James Rollins comes a novel
  of boundless imagination and meticulous research, a book that dares
  to answer a frightening question at the heart of America: Could the
  founding of the United States be based on a fundamental lie? The
  shocking truth lies hidden within the ruins of an impossibility, a
  lost colony of the Americas vanished in time and cursed into
  oblivion. A place known only as The Devil Colony.

  Deep in the Rocky Mountains, a gruesome discovery—hundreds of
  mummified bodies—stirs international attention and fervent
  controversy. Despite doubts about the bodies' origins, the local
  Native American Heritage Commission lays claim to the prehistoric
  remains, along with the strange artifacts found in the same cavern:
  gold plates inscribed with an unfathomable script.

  During a riot at the dig site, an anthropologist dies horribly,
  burned to ashes in a fiery explosion in plain view of television
  cameras. All evidence points to a radical group of Native Americans,
  including one agitator, a teenage firebrand who escapes with a vital
  clue to the murder and calls on the one person who might help—her
  uncle, Painter Crowe, Director of Sigma Force.

  To protect his niece and uncover the truth, Painter will ignite a
  war among the nation's most powerful intelligence agencies. Yet an
  even greater threat looms as events in the Rocky Mountains have set
  in motion a frightening chain reaction, a geological meltdown that
  threatens the entire western half of the U.S.

  From the volcanic peaks of Iceland to the blistering deserts of the
  American Southwest, from the gold vaults of Fort Knox to the
  bubbling geysers of Yellowstone, Painter Crowe joins forces with
  Commander Gray Pierce to penetrate the shadowy heart of a dark
  cabal, one that has been manipulating American history since the
  founding of the thirteen colonies.

  But can Painter discover the truth—one that could topple
  governments—before it destroys all he holds dear?

  The book is a collection of nine short stories telling the tale of
  three generations of a family before, during, and after a
  technological singularity. It was originally written as a series of
  novelettes and novellas, all published in Asimov's Science Fiction
  magazine in the period 2001 to 2004. According to Stross, the
  initial inspiration for the stories was his experience working as a
  programmer for a high-growth company during the dot-com boom of the
  1990s.

  The first three stories follow the character of agalmic "venture
  altruist" Manfred Macx, starting in the early 21st century; the
  second three stories follow his daughter Amber; and the final three
  focus largely on Amber's son Sirhan in the completely transformed
  world at the end of the century.

  It is the 27th century. The culture featured in the novel is based
  on the culture portrayed in the last chapter of Accelerando,
  "Survivor" (full chapter here). Humanity has spread throughout the
  galaxy using the wormhole technology copied from the alien routers,
  forming a plethora of societies and 'polities'.

  Robin, a human male, is recovering from a memory excision process in
  a rehabilitation centre. Though he remembers nothing of his past
  life(s), he suspects that he lived through traumatic times as a
  participant in the series of wars that raged many years
  before. Suspecting that he has been targeted for assassination by
  persons unknown, he agrees to sign-up with a radical, isolated
  social experiment that will attempt to recreate the forgotten "Dark
  Ages", the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

  On being transferred to the polity in which the program is being
  held, he discovers that he has been given the body of a woman,
  Reeve. As the experiment unfolds, she begins to suspect that all is
  not what it seems, and that the founders of the experiment are
  engaged in a very sinister conspiracy. Slowly, she realises that her
  role is not as clear-cut as she originally thought, which leads her
  to question, and then struggle against the program.

  For generations, the solar system -- Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid
  Belt -- was humanity's great frontier. Until now. The alien artifact
  working through its program under the clouds of Venus has appeared
  in Uranus's orbit, where it has built a massive gate that leads to a
  starless dark.

  Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla
  of scientific and military ships going out to examine the
  artifact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with
  the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the
  human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a
  threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.

  In Washington, D.C., a homeless man takes an assassin's bullet and
  dies in Commander Gray Pierce's arms. A bloody coin clutched in the
  dead man's hand--an ancient relic that can be traced back to the
  Greek Oracle of Delphi--is the key to a conspiracy that dates back
  to the Cold War and threatens the very foundation of humanity. For
  what if it were possible to bioengineer the next great prophet--a
  new Buddha, Muhammad, or even Jesus? Would this Second Coming be a
  boon . . . or would it initiate a chain reaction that would result
  in the extinction of humankind?

  Vital seconds are ticking rapidly away as Pierce races across the
  globe in search of answers, one step ahead of ruthless killers
  determined to reclaim the priceless artifact. Suddenly the future of
  all things is balanced on the brink between heaven and hell--and
  salvation or destruction rests in the hands of remarkable children.

  Meet Edinburgh Detective Inspector Liz Kavanaugh, head of the
  Innovative Crimes Investigation Unit, otherwise known as the Rule 34
  Squad. They monitor the Internet for potential criminal activity,
  analyzing trends in the extreme fringes of explicit content. And
  occasionally, even more disturbing patterns arise… Three ex-cons

  unorthodox entertainment. As the first officer on the scene of the
  most recent death, Liz finds herself sucked into an international

  what—and if she doesn't find the answer soon, the homicides could go

  At the same hospital, researcher Dr. Ranjip Singh is experimenting

  And now one of those people has access to the president's memories-

  pages, Blankets may well be the single largest graphic novel ever
  published without being serialized first. Wrapped in the landscape
  of a blustery Wisconsin winter, Blankets explores the sibling
  rivalry of two brothers growing up in the isolated country, and the
  budding romance of two coming-of-age lovers. A tale of security and
  discovery, of playfulness and tragedy, of a fall from grace and the
  origins of faith. A profound and utterly beautiful work from Craig
  Thompson. The New Printing corrects 3 small typos, widening the
  spine graphics, but otherwise is identical to the first printing.
