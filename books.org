  file://books/james-rollins-map-of-bones.jpg During a crowded service
  at a cathedral in Germany, armed intruders in monks' robes unleash a
  nightmare of blood and destruction. But the killers have not come
  for gold; they seek a more valuable prize: the bones of the Magi who
  once paid homage to a newborn savior ... a treasure that could
  reshape the world.

  file://books/robert-j-sawyer-www-wonder.jpg Webmind-the vast
  consciousness that spontaneously emerged from the infrastructure of
  the World Wide Web-has proven its worth to humanity by aiding in
  everything from curing cancer to easing international tensions. But
  the brass at the Pentagon see Webmind as a threat that needs to be
  eliminated.  Caitlin Decter-the once-blind sixteen-year-old math
  genius who discovered, and bonded with, Webmind-wants desperately to
  protect her friend. And if she doesn't act, everything-Webmind
  included-may come crashing down.

  file://books/charles-stross-halting-state.jpg In the year 2018,
  Sergeant Sue Smith of the Edinburgh constabulary is called in on a
  special case. A daring bank robbery has taken place at Hayek
  Associates, a dot-com startup company that's just been floated on
  the London stock exchange. The suspects are a band of marauding
  orcs, with a dragon in tow for fire support, and the bank is located
  within the virtual reality land of Avalon Four. For Smith, the
  investigation seems pointless. But she soon realizes that the
  virtual world may have a devastating effect in the real one-and that
  someone is about to launch an attack upon both...

* TOBUY [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891830430?ie%3DUTF8&ref%3Daw_bottom_links&force-full-site%3D1][Blankets - Craig Thompson]]                             :@graphicnovel:
  At 592 pages, Blankets may well be the single largest graphic novel
  ever published without being serialized first. Wrapped in the
  landscape of a blustery Wisconsin winter, Blankets explores the
  sibling rivalry of two brothers growing up in the isolated country,
  and the budding romance of two coming-of-age lovers. A tale of
  security and discovery, of playfulness and tragedy, of a fall from
  grace and the origins of faith. A profound and utterly beautiful
  work from Craig Thompson. The New Printing corrects 3 small typos,
  widening the spine graphics, but otherwise is identical to the first
  printing.
