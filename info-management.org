* Sending RSS feeds to mail
** Tools (investigated and actual)
*** [[http://newspipe.sourceforge.net/][newspipe]]
    - Status: NoGo
    - OPML used for data file.
    - Multiple cache files.
    - Seems to get multiple downloads of the same items.
*** [[http://www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/][rss2email]]
    - Status: In Use
    - Single merged cache/data
    - Verify that it works for nzb files in NZBIndex feeds.
      - Nope. Downloading the NZB fails.
      - Actually, yes. Use the Enclosure link instead of the URL
        link. Stupid.
    - Data file gets big and heavy. See conversation with author
      regarding the "reset" option. Should be used to periodically
      clean up the data file.
    - Hacked to use multiple data files.
    - Do not use distro packages. Download and install from the web site
    - Try the web interface
    - CSS may need customization to be less baby blue.
    - Locale needs to be added to headers. Getting results from
      NZBIndex in swedish...
*** [[http://home.gna.org/feed2imap/][feed2imap]]
    - Split cache/data files.
      - Single cache file.
    - Status: Testing
