#+TITLE: Automatic tools for cleaning up music downloads
#+FILETAGS: @project:@music
* Development directory is [[file:~/Dev/music-cleaner/][here]]
* Technologies
  - python
  - mutagen for tag editing
  - image manipulation with 
    - PIL
    - ImageMagick
* Ui Ideas
  - To pick cover art, build a jpg with all the candidates and label
    them with a number. At the same time, ask for the number at the
    command line.
* Converting as needed
  I don't keep FLAC or other lossless files around. So they would be
  automagically converted to AAC. Of course, metadata must be copied
  over.
  - Maybe script [[http://sbooth.org/Max/][Max]] to do this. Some leads [[http://forums.sbooth.org/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D2&t%3D1655&start%3D0][here]].
* Verify tagging and add album art
** Tasks to perform for each album
   - Verify that all tagging info is present and accurate
     - Manual / visual inspection by a human is acceptable, but data
       should be presented correctly.
     - Tag data to verify:
       - Artist name
       - Album name
       - Track name
       - Track number
       - Year
       - Genre
       - Total tracks
       - Album art
       - Compilation status (different artists on the same album)
     - Verify file name:
       - Non-compilation:
         track number - track name.ext
       - Compilation:
         track number - artist name - track name.ext
   - Get album art from a variety of sources
     - Discogs
     - Amazon
     - Album Art
* Sort loose files into directories
* Merge new albums into current collection
  - Current collection
