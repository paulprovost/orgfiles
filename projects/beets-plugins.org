#+TITLE: Plugin(s) for the beets tagger
#+FILETAGS: @music:@media:@tag

* Links
  - beets: the music geekâ€™s media organizer
    http://beets.radbox.org/

* sorting-helper plugin
  Enable better (!) handling of sorting and filing.
** Ideas
   - Automatically move opening articles (the, le, les la, ...) to the
     end of the sorting field.
   - For two (configurable) word artists, ask whether to invert the
     words for sorting.
     - Remember matches so that they can be used again.
   - Add path format fields for
     - artist sort order
     - artist sorting alpha group (09, A-Z)
*** Do it in the main line
    [[http://groups.google.com/group/beets-users/browse_thread/thread/1189b47fcfd2dadc][Asked]] the author on the mailing list, and got the ok to do it in
    the main line. Tasks:
    - Add sort fields to the AlbumInfo and TrackInfo objects in
      beets/autotag/hooks.py.
    - Populate these fields from the MB data in beets/autotag/mb.py.
    - Add tag mappings to MediaFile (mediafile.py).
    - Add the fields to the DB schema at the top of library.py.
    - Modify SQL "sort by" clauses in library.py to prefer sort fields.
