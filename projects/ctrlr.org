#+TITLE: Lemur-like iPad (also iPhone and iPod Touch) app
#+FILETAGS: @project:@iPad

* Name ideas
  - Control-R
  - ctrl-r
  - ctrl-R
  - ctrlr

* Requirements / Tech Specs
** Client/Server architecture
   - The server is running on controlled applications' host computer.
   - The client runs on the iPad/iPhone/iPod touch and displays the
     pages for the user to interact with
   - Pages are sent from the server to the client.
   - Pages are stored / defined on the server
** MV2C architecture
   - Model is the interface to the things that are being controlled:
     - Live
     - Mackie Control device
     - Plug-in controller
   - View displays to the user.
   - View2 receives input from the user.
   - Controller mediates communication.
** Client and server communicate through OSC
   - Both performance and internal data.
** Interface with Novation Automap
   - If the protocol details are made available.
     FWP: only client SDK is available. May need Audio Unit wrapper
     development to control plug-ins
** Use svg format for interfaces?
   Not natively supported on the iPhone. But parseable.
   - May be useful for rapid layout definition. maybe build a quick
     parser.
   - Should probably be converted from XML to JSON for better
     transmission...
** Screen DPI / widget sizes
   - iPhone DPI
     - Screen is 320x480 and 2"x3" -> 160 dpi
   - iPad DPI
     - Screen is 1024x768 @ 132 dpi
   - Conversion: iPad = iPhone * 0.825

* Technologies:
** [[http://livecontrol.q3f.org/ableton-liveapi/liveosc/][LiveOSC]]
   Remote MIDI Script for Live that allows control and broadcasts
   information on the current Live set.

* Applications
** Studio
*** Mixer / plugin control
*** Dedicated plugin controller
    - Be able to modify configuration from the display.
      - Add pages
      - Add controls to pages
*** Effects setup controller
    Have Live setup with different effects and be able to bring them
    in/out much like a clip-based performance.
** Live / performance
*** Effects controller
    - Possibly display only
    - Footswitch controlled
    - Control in-computer effects as well as outboard (using digitally
      controlled analog switcher)
    - Use AppleTV running MAX patch as in-rack computer
      (May have to run full Mac OS - for MIDI interface)
*** Lyric prompter
*** Live / clip based performace
**** General ideas
     - Have "undo" button.
     - Be able to set a state to return to, and return there at the
       push of a button.
     - Quickly preset states.
*** Looper-like performance
    - Display waveform (maybe multiple)
    - Quickly pick / add / delete tracks, with visual feedback (again,
      this may be laptop-only)

* Ideas
** Have a drawer for additional controls (switch views in Live)

** Use automap sdk to write automap interface for other software / devices (PODxt Live)
