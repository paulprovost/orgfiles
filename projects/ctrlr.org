#+TITLE: Lemur-like iPad (also iPhone and iPod Touch) app
#+FILETAGS: @project:@iPad
* Name ideas
  - Control-R
  - ctrl-r
  - ctrl-R
* Requirements / Tech Specs
** Client/Server architecture
   - The server is running on controlled applications' host computer.
   - The client runs on the iPad/iPhone/iPod touch and displays the
     pages for the user to interact with
   - Pages are sent from the server to the client.
   - Pages are stored / defined on the server
** Client and server communicate through OSC
   - Both performance and internal data.
** Interface with Novation Automap
   - If the protocol details are made available.
** Use svg format for interfaces?
   Not natively supported on the iPhone. But parseable.
   - May be useful for rapid layout definition. maybe build a quick
     parser.
   - Should probably be converted from XML to JSON for better
     transmission...
** Screen DPI / widget sizes
   - iPhone DPI
     - Screen is 320x480 and 2"x3" -> 160 dpi
   - iPad DPI
     - Screen is 1024x768 @ 132 dpi
   - Conversion: iPad = iPhone / 1.2121

   - Great OSC writeup, with MAX info (need to send/receive OSC in MAX
     as well...)
