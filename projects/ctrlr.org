* Requirements / Tech Specs
** Client/Server architecture
   - The server is running on controlled applications' host computer.
   - The client runs on the iPad/iPhone/iPod touch and displays the
     pages for the user to interact with
   - Pages are sent from the server to the client.
   - Pages are stored / defined on the server
** Client and server communicate through OSC
   - Both performance and internal data.
** Interface with Novation Automap
   - If the protocol details are made available.
** Use svg format for interfaces?

   - The app was built with SDK 2.1. Compiling with 3.2 for the
     simulator worked.
   - Must make changes to Info.plist bundle identifier to match your
     development certificate.
   - Info on certificates and provisioning at the
     [[http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/overview/index.action][iPhone Developer Program Portal]]
     - Installing and configuring a provisioning profile information [[http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/provisioningprofiles/howto.action][here]].

** Get the Automap SDK
   - [[http://www.focusrite.com/developer/lib/exe/fetch.php%3Fid%3Dautomapsdk&cache%3Dcache&media%3Dautomapsdk1.0b1.zip][Download]] from the Novation web site.
   - Additional usage information [[http://www.focusrite.com/developer/doku.php%3Fid%3Dautomapsdk][here]].
*** TODO Try it out.
    - Make a connection to the Automap server and have some parameters
      show up.
    - Try control both ways.
*** Seems that I don't want to write a client
    I really want to write a "device" that talks to the server.
** Write a MAX object that's an Automap client
