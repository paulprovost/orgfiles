#+TITLE: Install a Linux virtual machine on Hackintosh
#+AUTHOR: Paul Provost
#+EMAIL: paul@bouzou.org
#+DESCRIPTION: 
#+FILETAGS: @hackintosh

* Rationale
  - I have an i7-based machine with loads of RAM doing nothing.
  - I have an extra 240G SSD drive doing nothing
  - Maybe a VM on this kind of hardware will be faster than marauder
    (which, at the time of this writing, is running a with G of RAM on
    a rotating system disk)

* Requirements
  - Run straight off the physical disks in the machine.
  - Be accessible as another box on the network to run services and be
    accessible.

* Software solution
  - Testing out VMWare Fusion, hoping for better hardware integration
    and performance versus VirtualBox.
