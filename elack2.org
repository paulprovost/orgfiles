#+TITLE: Install a Linux virtual machine on Hackintosh
#+AUTHOR: Paul Provost
#+EMAIL: paul@bouzou.org
#+DESCRIPTION: 
#+FILETAGS: @hackintosh

* Rationale
  - I have an i7-based machine with 18G of RAM doing nothing.
  - I have an extra 120G SSD drive doing nothing
  - Maybe a VM on this kind of hardware will be faster than marauder
    (which, at the time of this writing, is running a AMD Athlon(tm)
    II X4 640 with 4G of RAM on a rotating system disk)
  - This machine refuses to boot from an USB stick at this point, so
    this might be better than dual-booting it (and involve less hair
    pulling).

* Requirements
  - Run straight off the physical disks in the machine.
  - Be accessible as another box on the network to run services and be
    accessible.
  - Accessed via NoMachine NX

* Software solution
  - Testing out VMWare Fusion, hoping for better hardware integration
    and performance versus VirtualBox.
    - Networking
      - Using "Bridged (autodetect)" setting for the network adapter
        gives me an address on the local network (192.168.1.x), which
        I had reserved for it on the router.

* Setup
    - Distro
      Lubuntu 14.04
    - SSH
      - Using port 2226
    - Font: Source Code Pro
      Installed TTFs into =~/.fonts=.
    - Terminator
    - Emacs 24
      Using the [[https://launchpad.net/~cassou/%2Barchive/emacs][PPA]]
    - devilspie
    - Transmission
    - python (pip, virtual environments)
      : $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
      : $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
    - conky
      - need =imap.py= and =conkycal.py= scripts.
      - need aptitude installed.
      - need Inconsolata font.

    I did not want to use disk images, hopefully to get better performance.

    The Apple SSD I used does not seem to support TRIM, but just in case...
