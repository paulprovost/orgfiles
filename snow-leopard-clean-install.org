#+TITLE: Snow Leopard clean install notes
#+DESCRIPTION:
#+FILETAGS: @snowleopard:@mac

* Context
  My current Mac OS X install was getting a bit dirty, so I figured I
  should do a clean install on another disk and move stuff over in a
  controlled fashion and only as needed. This was also to keep 
  control over what background processes are running and keep the
  machine as light as possible for audio stuff.
** Note: Always eject the old system disk
   Mac OS X is "smart" enough to find applications in /Applications
   folders on disks other than the startup one. So when rebooting, I
   must always make sure to eject the old system disk ("Pilot", in my
   case).
* Steps
  Steps from the clean install to a workable system.
  - In the Accounts Preferences, in the main user's advanced options,
    point to the "old" home directory on the RAID.
  - Remove all login items (if not, they will run off the old startup
    disk on startup and keep us from ejecting it, as well as bringing
    cruft over).
  - Set some Appearance Preferences (Display Layout, Background,
    Opaque Menu Bar).
  - Run Software Update as long as there are no more updates to
    install (2 times, in actual fact).
  - In Sharing Preferences, enable Screen Sharing (set a password for
    VNC clients in Computer Settings) and Remote Login (ssh). Change
    computer name (Moya) and set a password.
  - Start Mail and notice that all settings survived, along with
    plugins (MailTags, Mail Act-On, MsgFiler).
  - Copy Emacs over from Pilot (to start making these notes).
    - flyspell is not starting. ispell was installed from MacPorts.
  - Pair BlueTooth mouse.
  - Safari history survived.
  - Hazel still installed and configured.
  - MenuMeters still installed and configured.
  - Install [[https://www.dropbox.com/][DropBox]].
  - Install MacFuse and mount the sshfs file systems (the sshfs
    executable and all ssh keys are available).
  - Installed VLC
  - Installed Line6 drivers - failed with kext error
  - Installed VG-99 drivers
  - Installed MOTU MIDI Express 128 drivers
  - Installed LaunchBar (License made it through) (launch at startup)
  - Installed Printer drivers for Canon ImageCLASS 4370dn
    - Added printer
  - Installed Growl (all settings survived)
    - Installed Hardware Growler (launch at startup)
      - Used [[http://boredzo.org/cadt/][Configure Application Dock Tile]] to hide from Dock
  - Installed JollysFastVNC
  - Installed 1Password (browser extensions were already there and working)
  - Installed OmniWeb
  - Installed Unison 2
  - Installed HighPoint Web GUI ([[http://www.hptmac.com/US/product.php%3F_index%3D5&viewtype%3Ddownload][here]])
  - Installed Mercurial ([[http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/][download]])
    - For extra credit, install the mpkg remotely from the command line:
      - Determine the possible targets to install to:
        installer -pkg XXX.mpkg -volinfo
      - Do the actual install
        installer -pkg XXX.mpkg -target <target>
