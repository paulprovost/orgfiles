* Creating and keeping SSH tunnels
** Used tips from the [[http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Autossh#Using_OpenSSH.27s_built_in_connection_monitoring][Gentoo Wiki]]
   This uses the connection check from ssh. I just made an sh script
   to wrap that and I start it manually. It logs to syslog.
** NEXT Start SSH Tunnels at startup.

   [[http://bendingmcp.blogspot.com/2011/02/setting-up-permanent-ubuntu-ssh-tunnel.html][This guy]] has an init.d script to start this up. Might be worth it.
