*** My current usage                                               :@journal:
    My current usage for day-to-day tracking is a large journal file
    (or entry, like this one). Typically:
    - One dated top level entry per day.
    - Each thing done during the day that warrants talking about is a
      level 2 item below that.
    - Some items inside those will be tasks (TODOs).
    - As I work on a task, I make an entry with either a comment or
      additional notes.
    I'm not saying this is the correct/optimal way to do this, but
    this is what gelled for me after about a year.
**** Problem: Show all related entries in a journal
     Basically, I would like a way to loosely relate entries to each
     other, but on different days.
***** Use links
      - The originating item is a link target
      - Every new item that relates back should have a link to the
        target (maybe inside properties)
      - id:<id> links work to find an item within a file
      - org-id-copy copies the id of the current item to the kill
        ring, creating one if needed.
      - C-c l will store the current item with its link (org-id might
        have to be loaded first).
***** Maybe a python script to generate a list for a particular item
***** Use org-depend
