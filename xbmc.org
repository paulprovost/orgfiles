** [2011-01-09 Sun]
   After failed attempt to get video sources added on Moya to sync on
   Nermal, wiped the install on Moya, installed latest version and
   created a new database.
   - Added the database settings to advancedsettings.xml
   - Switched to windowed mode and added the resolution settings to
     advancedsettings.xml. 

* Notes
** Starting XBMC with custom window resolution.
   Add the following to advancedsettings.xml in your user folder.
   : <window> 
   :     <height>720</height> 
   :     <width>1280</width> 
   : </window>
