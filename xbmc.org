   After failed attempt to get video sources added on Moya to sync on
   Nermal, wiped the install on Moya, installed latest version of XBMC
   (10.0 r35648) and created a new database.
   - Added the database settings to advancedsettings.xml
   - Switched to windowed mode and added the resolution settings to
     advancedsettings.xml. 
   - Checked that the database tables were created. Good.
   - Setting the domain for the SMB client and restarting.
   - Adding a source for series (FARSCAPE workgroup not seen, so I
     added the URL by hand):
     : smb://paul:<PWD>@aurorachair/paul-aurorachair/media/video/series/english
     Named "Series - English"
   - Scanned the contents.
   - Scanned again. Some series were not scanned the first
     time. Titles, but no episodes. Might be the unRAID delays.
   - Some banners/thumbnails are not there. Might be due to SickBeard.

   - Erased profile on Nermal. Checked that directory is gone.
   - Created profile again, with all default options.
   - Copied advancedsettings.xml and logged in.
   - Series are there, with number of episodes, but the seasons and
     episodes are not there when selecting a series.
     - There are a lot of "no matching source" errors in the logs.

   - Second try
     - Erased profile on Nermal. Checked that directory is gone.
     - Created profile again, with all default options.
     - Logged in, and added the same source, but do not update it.
     - Logged out, copied advancedsettings.xml and logged in.
     - Updated library (unsure if needed). Seems to be working
       (episodes are there and watched marks are ok).

* Notes
** Starting XBMC with custom window resolution.
   Add the following to advancedsettings.xml in your user folder.
   : <window> 
   :     <height>720</height> 
   :     <width>1280</width> 
   : </window>  
** Cleaning data / making nfo/tbn files automatically
   - The only non-windows-only option seems to be [[http://www.24hourloop.com/projects/mediareader][Media Reader]] (java,
     but, well). Dependencies are easier to install on Linux, so
     installing on Marauder. Documentation is in a PDF file called
     "Media Reader.pdf".
     - Install mediainfo from deb packages [[http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download/Ubuntu][here]].
     - Install ffmpeg from repository
