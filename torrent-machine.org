* Rationale
  - Things being what they are, it would be better to go through a VPN
    when downloading from torrents

* Journal
** [2014-09-12 Fri] Use a virtual machine
** [2015-01-23 Fri] Make sure that the connection stays up
   The VPN connection seems to fall unresponsive when (I guess) the
   ISP connection comes down and back up again. To test:
   : ping -I tun0 google.ca
   To bring the VPN down and back up again:
   : sudo nmcli c down <UUID>
   : sudo nmcli c up <UUID>
*** TODO wrap in a cron job

** TODO [2015-01-25 Sun] VPN Watchdog
   VPN connection seems to go dead periodically, probably whenever the
   outside IP address changes. Write a shell script to run in crontab
   that checks if the ouside is accessible (via ping) and then
   restarts the connection. Log each occurence to syslog.
   - Check connection using ping
     : ADDRESS=google.ca
     : #ping -W1 -c1 -I tun0 $ADDRESS >/dev/null 2>&1
     : dig +time=1 $ADDRESS >/dev/null 2>&1
     : result=$?
     : if [ $result -ne 0 ]; then
     :     logger vpnwatchdog VPN not responding
     : fi
** using straight openvpn command line for VPN connection
   This is much more stable than using Network Manager
   : sudo openvpn --config vpn/configs/ipvanish-US-New-York-nyc-c02.ovpn --ca vpn/configs/ca.ipvanish.com.crt --auth-user-pass vpn/password.txt
   - The config files are downloaded from 

   - =vpn/password.txt= contains
   : <username>
   : <password>

* Setup
  - Distribution: [[http://lubuntu.net/][lubuntu]]
    - Do not set up to log on automatically
    - Install SSH server
      : sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    - Enable passwordless login (see [[file:tech-notes.org::*SSH%20login%20without%20password][here]])
    - Add user to the =debian-transmission= group
      : sudo adduser paul debian-transmission
  - VPN: [[https://www.ipvanish.com/][IPVanish]] using OpenVPN
    - Install network-manager-openvpn
      : sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn
    - Configure from the tray applet by importing a configuration file
      - download the certificate (=ca.ipvanish.com.crt=) and a
        configuration from [[https://www.ipvanish.com/software/configs/][here]].
      - Create a =~/vpn= directory and put the files there.
      - This does not work for the first one. Enter that one by hand
        - Gateway: server address
        - Authentication
          - Type: Password
          - Username: <IPVanish user name>
          - Password: <IPVanish password>
          - Certificate: point to the =ca.ipvanish.com.crt= file
        - Advanced
          - General
            - Use LZO data compression
            - Use a TCP connection
          - Security
            - Cipher: AES-256-CBC
            - HMAC Authentication: SHA-256
      - Command line operation
        Edit =/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<connection
        name>= and under =[vpn]=, change
        : password-flags=0
        and add
        : [vpn-secrets]
        : password=<password>
        - List all connections from the command line
          : sudo nmcli con
        - Status from the command line
          : sudo nmcli con status
        - Start from the command line
          : nmcli con up uuid <UUID>
        - Stop from the command line
          : nmcli con down uuid <UUID>

  - Torrent downloader: [[https://www.transmissionbt.com/][Transmission]] daemon
    : sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon
    - Modify config:
      :   "bind-address-ipv4": "<VPN address>"
      :   "rpc-whitelist": "192.168.1.*"
      :   "umask": 2
    - Change permissions on download folder
      : sudo chmod g+s /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads
    - Add a bind mount in =/etc/fstab= for the downloads folder in
      home directory
      : /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/
      :      /home/paul/torrent-downloads   none   defaults,bind 0 0
    - Verify torrent IP address at [[http://ipmagnet.services.cbcdn.com][ipMagnet]]
    - Outside IP address:
      : dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
