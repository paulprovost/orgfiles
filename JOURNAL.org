** Track changes made when installing                        :@install:@linux
   - Use
     : find ~/local -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
     before and after the install, and diff between them.

* [2012-04-05 Thu] Installed surfraw from source on drd1812 :@install:@surfraw:
  The packaged surfraw was having trouble with opening web
  pages. Chrome would start, but only show a blank page. I figured I
  would install from [[http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/][source]]. All went well, but the bash completion
  was gone with the Debian package. To bring it back, I added the
  following (with inspiration from [[http://www.scons.org/wiki/BashCompletion][here]], which is for another package,
  but showed me how to create a =.bash_completion.d= directory and
  source all its contents). I ended up with a =.bash_completion= as
  follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  # -*- mode:shell-script -*-
  for file in ~/.bash_completion.d/*
  do
      [[ ${file##*/} != @(*~|*.bak|*.swp|\#*\#|*.dpkg*|.rpm*) ]] &&
          [ \( -f $file -o -h $file \) -a -r $file ] &&
          . $file
  done
  #+END_SRC
  Then I copied the =surfraw-bash-completion= file from the install
  into =~/.bash_completion.d/=. I can now complete elvis' and
  bookmarks (=sr= =TAB= =TAB=).

* [2012-10-29 Mon 11:54] Upgrade linux boxen to 12.10   :@homenetwork:@linux:
** Issue with NX Client on Windows not showing the text.
  - [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=141884][No fonts in NX (Page 1) / Newbie Corner / Arch Linux Forums]]
    Root cause. Does not play nicely with libcairo2 1.12. Suggest
    downgrading to 1.10

* [2012-11-11 Sun 13:38] AppleTV upgrade                     :@appletv:@htpc:
** Received the Broadcom CrystalHD card
   - Ordered from - [[http://jhetech.com/broadcom-bcm970015-vd-920-70015-mini-pci-e-hd-decoder-720-1080-apple-tv][Jhe Technology]]
   - Installed as per [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DARx5Dh7t90E][this]]. Removing the rubber boot _was_ indeed a bitch.
** Removed the hard disk and the fan.                   :@headphones:@iphone:
   While I was at it, I removed the hard disk and the fan. The unit
   refused to reboot after that. Yet another disk order issue. To fix:
   - Boot with the hard disk attached. I could not find a way to mount
     the Recovery partition writeable on Linux.
   - Run a file system check and remount the partition as writeable:
     : sudo fsck.hfsplus -f /dev/sdb1
     : sudo mount -o rw,force /dev/sdb1 /media/Recovery
   - Label the root and swap partitions so that they can be referred
     to independently of their letter assignement.
     : sudo e2label /dev/sdb3 ROOT
     : sudo swapoff -a
     : sudo mkswap -L SWAP /dev/sdb2
   - Edit =/media/Recovery/com.apple.Boot.plist= and change
     =root=/dev/sdb3= to =root=LABEL=ROOT=.
   - Edit =/etc/fstab= and change =/dev/sdb3= to =LABEL=ROOT=
     and =/dev/sdb2= to =LABEL=SWAP=.
   I should have watched [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-9yYN-DUP-I][this]]

* [2014-07-23 Wed] Fixed missing unicode symbols                     :@emacs:
  Frustrated by seeing character codes in boxes when displaying some
  tweets, I heeded the advice on defining a fallback font in emacs
  (from [[http://endlessparentheses.com/manually-choose-a-fallback-font-for-unicode.html][Endless Parenthesis]]). In a nutshell,
  - Install Symbola
  - Add to .emacs
    : (set-fontset-font "fontset-default" nil 
    :                   (font-spec :size 20 :name "Symbola"))
  - Restart emacs.
  Presto. Symbols in Wanderlust!

* [2014-09-29 Mon] Adding Roundcube as a mailto handler in Firefox :@firefox:
  - Enable registering protocol handlers from different hosts:
    - open =about:config=
    - Look for =gecko.handlerService.allowRegisterFromDifferentHost=
      and set it to =true=.
    - Open the Javascript console (Tools->Web Developer->Web Console)
      and execute:
      : navigator.registerProtocolHandler("mailto", "https://www.bouzou.org/mail/?_task=mail&amp;_action=compose&amp;_to=%s", "Bouzou")
    - Set =gecko.handlerService.allowRegisterFromDifferentHost= to =false=.

* [2015-02-09 Mon] Called BMO regarding contestation of charge :@mastercard:@banking:@bmo:

  - The investigation committee will contact the company
  - If the company does not respond, the committee will make
    reimbursement permanent
