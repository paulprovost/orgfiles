* New Ideas
** Track changes made when installing                        :@install:@linux
   - Use
     : find ~/local -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
     before and after the install, and diff between them.

* [2012-04-05 Thu] Installed surfraw from source on drd1812 :@install:@surfraw:
  The packaged surfraw was having trouble with opening web
  pages. Chrome would start, but only show a blank page. I figured I
  would install from [[http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/][source]]. All went well, but the bash completion
  was gone with the Debian package. To bring it back, I added the
  following (with inspiration from [[http://www.scons.org/wiki/BashCompletion][here]], which is for another package,
  but showed me how to create a =.bash_completion.d= directory and
  source all its contents). I ended up with a =.bash_completion= as
  follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  # -*- mode:shell-script -*-
  for file in ~/.bash_completion.d/*
  do
      [[ ${file##*/} != @(*~|*.bak|*.swp|\#*\#|*.dpkg*|.rpm*) ]] &&
          [ \( -f $file -o -h $file \) -a -r $file ] &&
          . $file
  done
  #+END_SRC
  Then I copied the =surfraw-bash-completion= file from the install
  into =~/.bash_completion.d/=. I can now complete elvis' and
  bookmarks (=sr= =TAB= =TAB=).

* TODO [#A] [2012-04-12 Thu 15:27] Bad handling of periods in links. :@issue:@twit2rss:
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "TODO"       from ""           [2012-04-12 Thu 15:27]
  :END:
  Periods are swallowed into the link text when links are linkified.

* [2012-04-30 Mon] Montreal Python #29                       :@python:@mtlpy:

  - Levenshtein distance - distance between two words
  - Gunicorn - WSGI server
  - Supervisor - manage daemon processes (like WSGI servers)
  - WebCore
    - toscawidgets?
    - scrypt for encryption?

* [2012-10-29 Mon 11:54] Upgrade linux boxen to 12.10   :@homenetwork:@linux:
** Issue with NX Client on Windows not showing the text.
  - [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=141884][No fonts in NX (Page 1) / Newbie Corner / Arch Linux Forums]]
    Root cause. Does not play nicely with libcairo2 1.12. Suggest
    downgrading to 1.10
