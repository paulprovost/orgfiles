** [2014-06-05 Thu]
   Tried out the TL-WR702N router in bridge mode. Bridge mode does
   *not* create a separate network for the Pi and the iPad. Nor do any
   of the router's modes. Bah.
** [2014-06-07 Sat] Works!
   Using the first two articles in the [[*Raspberry%20Pi%20as%20a%20router%20(Wifi%20to%20Wifi,%20hopefully)][links]].
   - wlan0 connects to a wireless network (using wicd)
   - wlan1 is an access point that clients can connect to (tested
     with prowler and iPhone, but it should work with the iPad).
   - Once connected to the home Wifi, it can be accessed as
     tailgunner from the internal network (it gets a 192.168.1.x ip
     address).
*** Reboot test...
    Survived! Great Googly Moogly! Now to test on the go. And
    wicd-curses is not exactly user friendly when asking for
    passwords and setting options. More studying...
** [2014-10-02 Thu] Moving to a MicroSD card
   Got a better Pi enclosure ([[http://www.adafruit.com/products/1124][Pibow]]), so I figured this would be the
   right time to move to using a MicroSD card in a [[http://www.adafruit.com/products/1763][low-profile
   adapter]], so it's not prone to being damaged in transport. Cloning
   the SD card I currently have installed is proving to be a problem,
   since the MicroSD card is smaller than the SD card. I tried
   resizing the partitions on the original so that it fits (10GB), but
   dd reports the same size when cloning to an image file. I'll try
   restoring again just in case, but if this fails, I'll have to copy
   the partition table and then clone the partitions individually.

** [2014-10-09 Thu] Use it as a DLNA server
   So I got the weird idea to use tailgunner as a portable DLNA
   server, to bring media on the road and play it on Apple devices.
   - Install minidlna (now [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/][ReadyMedia]]) as described [[http://bbrks.me/rpi-minidlna-media-server/][here]].
   - The number of inotify watches was too small, so I cranked it as
     described [[http://monodevelop.com/Inotify_Watches_Limit][here]].
     : echo 16384 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
     That's only temporary though. Better to add the line
     : fs.inotify.max_user_watches=16384
     at the end of =/etc/sysctl.conf=, as stated [[http://askubuntu.com/questions/148171/dropbox-error-echo-100000-sudo-tee-proc-sys-fs-inotify-max-user-watches][here]].
   - Setting it to start on boot with
     : update-rc.d minidlna defaults
     failed. [[http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f%3D66&t%3D68263][Apparently]], this is caused by some issue with the init
     script for Wolfram's Mathematica. Much as I respect Stephen
     Wolfram, he's not going to mess up my project.
     : sudo apt-get remove wolfram-engine
     Boom.
** [2014-10-14 Tue] Not quite, it turns out.
   The server would not advertise on wlan1. I had to add
   : network_interface=wlan0,wlan1
   in =minidlna.conf=. Then, boom!
** [2014-12-25 Thu] Bah! hostapd does not start
   All of a sudden (after powering off for a while, then on), I get:
   : ioctl[RTL_IOCTL_HOSTAPD]: Invalid argument

* Software
** Emacs 24.3
   - Compile from source using [[https://coderwall.com/p/uztyfw][instructions]]
     Must update repositories before installing dependencies.
*** Config
    - Copy over =.emacs=, =.wl=, =.folders=, =.abbrev_defs=.
    - Remove the additions to =load-path=.
    - site-lisp (manual installation)
      - mercurial.el
    - packages
      - monky
      - expand-region
      - color-themes
      - todochiku - No
        Needs notify-send, which uses a notify daemon. I want to keep
        the number of daemons running to a minimum.
      - helm

** VNC server
   [[http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/][x11vnc]]
   : $ startx
   : $ x11vnc --avahi --forever --passwd raspberry
** Window Manager
   - Rationale:
     - Graphical Emacs might be nice as it displays images, but I want
       to cut down on mouse fiddling since I will be on an iPad.
     - VNC connection should be fast enough, as I will be sitting
       right on the machine.

* Setup
** Raspberry Pi
*** Distribution
    - [[http://www.raspbian.org/][Raspbian]] ([[http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/][download]])
    - Install on SD Card using [[http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/raspberry-pi/macosx-apple-pi-baker/][ApplePi-Baker]]
*** Customization
**** Rename the default user
     This is so that I keep 1000:1000 as UID/GID
     - Give root a password
       : $ sudo passwd root
     - (as root) Change the name of the default pi user
       : # usermod -l paul pi
     - (as root) Change the name of the home directory
       : # usermod -m -d /home/paul paul
     - (as root) Change the name of the default group
       : # groupmod -n paul pi
     - Disable root
       : $ sudo passwd -l root
